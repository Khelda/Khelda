# About me

A small tinkering dev, alone to wander the plains of Github. I do a bunch of Neovim, some odd projects and mostly every possible tech I can think of when I need it.

## Main tools

- Editor : [Neovim](https://github.com/Khelda/nvim-config)
- Shell : [ZSH](https://github.com/Khelda/zshrc.d)

## Working on...

### MeriseDot

A (not so) small project inspired by [Looping] being an absolute moron when I tried to run it and a lot of spite to make my own database editor, *including compatibility* with [Looping].
