# About me

A small tinkering dev, alone to wander the plains of Github. I do a bunch of Neovim, some odd projects and mostly every possible tech I can think of when I need it.

## Main tools

- Editor : [Neovim](https://github.com/Khelda/nvim-config)
- Shell : [ZSH](https://github.com/Khelda/zshrc.d)

## Working on...

### MeriseDot

A (not so) small project inspired by [Looping] being an absolute moron when I tried to run it and a lot of spite to make my own database editor, *including compatibility* with [Looping]. Still a work in progress though, no GUI in the works for now. At least, not yet.

### Project Lakemourne

A TTRPG project with friends, requiring some utilities to handle the paperwork. That, and we wanted to experiment with [Obsidian]-related tech to keep track of everything that may or may not happen during development and writing.
